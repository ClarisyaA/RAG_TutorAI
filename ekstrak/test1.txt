ABSTRACT 
The WBS or the Work Breakdown Structure is essential 
as part of project’s lifecycle and timeline. An important 
part of Project planning, the WBS begins with a 
hierarchy of tasks and levels that help to identify how 
the project will flow within a designed timeline set by 
the project manager .The project management institute 
defines the WBS as “ Representing the sum total 
decomposition of all work that the project encompasses, 
from beginning to end ” . 
 
Keywords - WBS, work breakdown structure, 
milestones, stakeholder. 
1     INTRODUCTION 
            A complex project is made manageable by first 
breaking it down into individual components in a 
hierarchical structure, known as the work breakdown 
structure, or the WBS. Such a structure defines tasks that 
can be completed independently of other tasks, facilitating 
resource allocation, assignment of responsibilities, and 
measurement and control of the project. 
      Company owners and project managers use the Work 
Breakdown Structure (WBS) to make complex projects 
more manageable. The WBS is designed to help break down 
a project into manageable chunks that can be effectively 
estimated and supervised. 
Some widely used reasons for creating a WBS include: 
 
Assists with accurate project organization  
 
Helps with assigning responsibilities  
 
Shows the control points and project milestones  
 
Allows for more accurate estimation of cost, risk 
and time 
 
Helps explain the project scope to stakeholders 
The introduction of the paper should explain the nature of 
the problem, previous work, purpose, and the contribution of

2   PURPOSE  
The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) divides the entire project 
into its component elements in order to establish a framework for 
effective management control of the project scope, schedule and 
budget. 
 
 
 
3   SCOPE 
 The WBS is a product-oriented, hierarchical depiction of all work 
elements required to accomplish the entire work scope of the 
project. Project Managers are responsible for the creation of a 
WBS. 
4    PROCEDURE 
4.1 Structure  
                      A project WBS is a product-oriented grouping of 
project work elements that organizes and defines the total scope of 
the project. The WBS is a multi-level framework that organizes 
and graphically displays elements representing work to be 
accomplished in logical relationships. Each descending level 
represents an increasingly detailed definition/division of a project 
component. It is the structure and code that integrates and relates 
all project work (technical, schedule, and budget) and is used 
throughout the life cycle of a project to identify, assign, and track 
specific work scopes. The WBS will be established in sufficient 
detail so that each control account has a unique WBS element. The 
WBS is described in the Project Execution Plan (PEP), or attached 
as an appendix. 
4.2 Responsibility  
                              Project Managers are responsible for the 
creation of a WBS for their assigned projects, with input from 
other members of the project team. 
 
4.2.1   Constructing a Work Breakdown Structure  
To start out, the project manager and subject matter experts 
determine the main deliverables for the project. Once this is 
completed, they start decomposing the deliverables they have 
identified, breaking them down to successively smaller chunks of 
work. 
"How small?" you may ask. That varies with project type and 
management style, but some sort of predetermined “rule” should 
govern the size and scope of the smallest chunks of work. There 
could be a two weeks rule, where nothing is broken down any 
smaller than it would take two weeks to complete. You can also 
use the 8/80 rule, where no chunk would take less than 8 hours or 
longer than 80 hours to complete. Determining the chunk size 
“rules” can take a little practice, but in the end these rules make 
the WBS easier to use.

4.2.2 
What is the WBS and Why Is It Important? 
The WBS, or the Work Breakdown Structure, is essential as part of 
a project's lifecycle and timeline. An important part of project 
planning, the WBS begins with a hierarchy of tasks and levels that 
help to identify how the project will flow within a designed 
timeline set by the project manager. The Project Management 
Institute defines the WBS as, "Representing the sum total 
decomposition of all work that the project encompasses, from 
beginning to end." 
So, didn't you already discuss this in your project initiation 
meetings? Weren't teams chosen and tasks assigned? Isn't everyone 
on the same page and ready to go? 
Perhaps, but utilizing a WBS to outline where the project will start, 
what phases, levels, and tasks will be first, second, third, and so on, 
and the project's duration is essential any project's success. 
Skipping the WBS could cause delays, confused tasking by team 
members and project overruns. The WBS also helps to define the 
specifics of the project outlined in the project scope. 
4.2.3 
Developing the work breakdown structure  
4.2.3.1 
Work packages  
Work package is the final product of the work breakdown 
structure .It is a collection of a series of related job or task , 
it is situated in the bottom of the work breakdown structure, 
something that is easy to be controlled by project team 
members. It is also the basis for subsequent management of 
projects and based on all the progress of the plan, quality 
management planning, cost planning, staffing is based on it 
is the smallest unit of project management. 
In work breakdown structures, when a series of work 
package, we can refer to the following principles: 
 
Work packages are independently deliverable units, 
it should be clear, the only. 
 
Work tasks in a package should be able to 
explicitly implement in an organization or 
individual. 
 
Work package life cycle should be the shortest. 
 
Clear work packages and relationship to other work 
packages 
 
Work package to determine the actual cost of 
budget, human and resource needs. 
 
Work most of the tasks in the package on 
adaptability of project personnel should have the 
same type in the group. 
4.2.3.2 Key elements 
In the previous section introduced in work package should 
note or refer some of the principles, that is when the original 
production work package have some reference value .when 
after a series of work packages are broken down , the project 
group on how these work packages ,or ,after the team got 
the work package ,you need to do what work ? 
Recommendations are as follows: 
 
 
Content describes the process or activity. 
According to the project scope statement, for each 
work package describe, indicate that the nature of 
the work package. 
 
Assign responsible persons. Identify related 
organizations and individuals responsible for the 
task work package. That is, they work to complete 
the tasks of the package. 
 
Work package life cycle. That is, determine the 
start time and end time of the work package. 
 
Pursuant to a work package to develop plans or 
allocation of necessary resources. Such as: the 
progress plan for each work package, cost 
estimates, quality management schemes. 
4.2.3.3 
Work breakdown structure and milestones 
In the work breakdown structure element (work package, a 
middle-tier or work breakdown structure) when completed, 
will output a series of deliverables. At the same time, 
according to the actual situation of the project, the team can 
make this unit of work associated with a milestone. 
Milestone marks one of the results or stages of work 
completed. Typically, the milestone is closely associated 
with and deliverables. When reaching milestones, project 
team members can subscribe to a project summary, 
reflection. If problems are found, you can take the necessary 
remedial measures. Milestone exists to make specific for 
team goals, compared with the main objective of the project 
and deliverables, milestones more easily and control, to 
reduce project risks. 
According to the work breakdown structure, a point in the 
process of the project is running social milestone is 
meaningful.

4.3 Creating a WBS for the Project Duration  
Once we have gotten the first two levels set, it is time to launch 
into our decomposition or breakdown. Decomposition is the act of 
breaking down deliverables in to successively smaller chunks of 
work to be completed in order to achieve a level of work that can 
be both realistically managed by the Project Manager and 
completed within a given time frame by one or more team 
members. This level of breakdown and detail is called the Work 
Package. Work packages are the lowest level of the WBS and are 
pieces of work that are specifically assigned to one person or one 
team of people to be completed. This is also the level at which the 
Project Manger has to monitor all project work. 
The importance of defining a project's duration becomes something 
you and your team members can see, feel, and touch if you utilize a 
WBS in the project's lifecycle. Avoiding the all important work 
breakdown structure can be costly. 
4.4 
Why Do Project Teams Need a Work Breakdown 
Structure?  
The work breakdown structure has a number of benefits in addition 
to defining and organizing the project work. A project budget can 
be allocated to the top levels of the work breakdown structure, and 
department budgets can be quickly calculated based on the each 
project’s work breakdown structure. By allocating time and cost 
estimates to specific sections of the work breakdown structure, a 
project schedule and budget can be quickly developed. As the 
project executes, specific sections of the work breakdown structure 
can be tracked to identify project cost performance and identify 
issues and problem areas in the project organization. For more 
information Project work breakdown structures can also be used to 
identify potential risks in a given project. If a work breakdown 
structure has a branch that is not well defined then it represents a 
scope definition risk. These risks should be tracked in a project log 
and reviewed as the project executes. By integrating the work 
breakdown structure with an organization breakdown structure, the 
project manager can also identify communication points and 
formulate a communication plan across the project organization.

project manager can also identify communication points and 
formulate a communication plan across the project organization. 
When a project is falling behind, referring the work breakdown 
structure will quickly identify the major deliverables impacted by a 
failing work package or late sub- deliverable. The work breakdown 
structure can also be color coded to represent sub- deliverable 
status. Assigning colors of red for late, yellow for at risk, green for 
on-target, and blue for completed deliverables is an effective way 
to produce a heat-map of project progress and draw management’s 
attention to key areas of the work breakdown structure. 
In this article we are going to look at what many project managers 
and project management professionals refer to as the "foundation" 
of the project, or at least the foundation of project planning. The 
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is defined by A Guide to the 
Project Management Body of Knowledge 3rd Edition (PMBOK 
Guide) as: 
A deliverable oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to 
be executed by the project team to accomplish the project 
objectives and create the required deliverables. 
Wow! That is a lot of buzz words and jargon, but do not worry. It 
is not nearly as daunting as it sounds. Creating a quality WBS will 
require a substantial amount of energy, time, and people, but in the 
end is not rocket science. However, before we get too deep into 
how to actually create a WBS let's first look at its purpose. 
4.4.1 Purpose of work breakdown structure  
Why do we need to create a WBS for our projects? What purpose 
does it serve? Why should I waste my time writing on post-it notes 
and drawing charts when I could be getting my team started on the 
actual work of the project? Now, I know everyone reading this is a 
great project manager or team member, so I am sure none of you 
have ever said comments such as these, but I am sure you have 
heard them from those "other" project managers who will remain 
nameless. 
So to answer these questions, let's take a look at what purpose the 
WBS serves to our project and our project team. There are three 
reasons to use a WBS in your projects. The first is that is helps 
more accurately and specifically define and organize the scope of 
the total project. The most common way this is done is by using a 
hierarchical tree structure. Each level of this structure breaks the 
project deliverables or objectives down to more specific and 
measurable chunks. The second reason for using a WBS in your 
projects is to help with assigning responsibilities, resource 
allocation, monitoring the project, and controlling the project. The 
WBS makes the deliverables more precise and concrete so that the 
project team knows exactly what has to be accomplished within 
each deliverable. This also allows for better estimating of cost, 
risk, and time because you can work from the smaller tasks back 
up to the level of the entire project. Finally, it allows you double 
check all the deliverables' specifics with the stakeholders and make 
sure there is nothing missing or overlapping. 
The main purpose of Work Breakdown Structure is that firstly, it 
helps to define and organize the scope of the total project more 
accurately and specifically. The most common way this is done is

breaks the project deliverables or objectives down to more specific 
and measurable chunks. The second reason for using a Work

precise and concrete so that the project team knows exactly what 
has to be accomplished within each deliverable. 
This also allows for better estimating of cost, risk, and time 
because you can work from the smaller tasks back up to the level 
of the entire project. Finally, it allows you double check all the 
deliverables' specifics with the stakeholders and make sure there is 
nothing missing or overlapping. Besides, using the tree structure, 
you may also use Mind Mapping methodology, if you are familiar 
with it. 
The very common question is how specific or small does a chunk 
of work need to be to still be considered a work package? Well 
PMBOK does not seem to give a definitive answer on that. Most 
project managers concur that this varies by project, but can usually 
be measured using the 8/80 Rule. The 8/80 Rule says that no work 
package should be less than 8 hours or greater than 80 hours. 
Notice we said that the work package is the lowest level of the 
WBS. Activities and tasks are not included in the WBS. They will 
be planned from the work packages once they are assigned.

COMMON PITFALLS AND MISCONCEPTIONS 
  A WBS is not an exhaustive list of work. It is instead a 
comprehensive classification of project scope.  
 
  A WBS is not a project plan or a project schedule and it is 
not a chronological listing. It is considered poor practice to 
construct a project schedule (e.g. using project management 
software) before designing a proper WBS. This would be 
similar to scheduling the activities of home construction 
before completing the house design. Without concentrating 
on planned outcomes, it is very difficult to follow the 100% 
Rule at all levels of the WBS hierarchy. It is not possible to 
recover from an improperly defined WBS without starting 
over, so it is worthwhile to finish the WBS design before 
starting a project plan or project schedule.  
 
A WBS is not an organizational hierarchy. Some 
practitioners make the mistake of creating a WBS that 
shadows the organizational chart. While it is common for 
responsibility to be assigned to organizational elements, a 
WBS that shadows the organizational structure is not 
descriptive of the project scope and is not outcome-oriented.  
 
Short-term memory capacity should not dictate the size and 
span of a WBS tree structure. Some reference material 
suggests that each WBS level be limited to 5-9 elements 
because that is a theoretical limit to short-term memory. It is 
far more important to construct a logical grouping of 
planned outcomes than to worry about the limits of short-
term human memory.  
WBS updates, other than progressive elaboration of details, 
require formal change control. This is another reason why a 
WBS should be outcome-oriented and not be prescriptive of 
methods. Methods can and do changes frequently, but 
changes in planned outcomes require a higher degree of 
formality. If outcomes and actions are blended, change 
control may be too rigid for actions and too informal for 
outcomes. 
6 
CONCLUSION 
At the risk of sounding melodramatic, the efficiency of a 
project’s Work Breakdown Structure can determine that 
project’s success. The WBS provides the foundation for 
project planning, cost estimation, scheduling and resource 
allocation, not to mention risk management.
